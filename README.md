Subclass of `JTextPane` that is capable of syntax highlighting XML text.

The component is written in the Java language. The build tool used is Maven. 

After I wrote the initial version of this code I made a small blog entry on my wiki. It turned out there was quite some interest in the community so I decided to publish the code here.

Please feel free to download the code, use it and comment on it. Please let us know if you are using the code!!
